# Suzie the cat telegram bot

## General
A bot that allows you to feed, pet or play with a cat named Suzie. In addition to the above, you can request a photo of a cat and get one random photo from a [set of assets](https://github.com/viacheslav-chugunov/suzie-the-cat-bot/tree/main/assets/cat). You can try the bot [here](t.me/suziethecatbot).

## How to host
If the bot does not work, then most likely it is not hosted on the server. You can run main.py through the console or IDE and the bot will work!
